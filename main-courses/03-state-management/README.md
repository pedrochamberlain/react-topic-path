# State Management in Pure React, v2

As your applications grow, the root of performance and maintainability problems often stems from how you structure and manage state. In this course, we’ll look at the core APIs in React to handle state, including both in the traditional component state, as well as in React hooks. You’ll move onto creating custom hooks, use reducers, and then learn ways to do more complicated state management techniques such as using the Context API.
